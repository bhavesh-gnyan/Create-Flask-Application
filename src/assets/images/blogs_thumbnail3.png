The contents of the file 'src/assets/images/blogs_thumbnail3.png' are not required for a programmer to write code, as it is an image asset and does not contain any programming logic or text content. However, if you need its path in your application, you can use this string: `"../assets/images/blogs_thumbnail3.png"`. This assumes that the file is located at 'src' level of your Angular project structure.
